# Collect Stats

## Overview
Born out of an interview question and my resulting fumble. Lots to do.

The (currently) primary entry point is actually net/netstat.py
Tests are currently invoked directly:
```python3 test_netstat.py
```

## Known Issues
Tests will not work without being copied/moved alongside netstat.py
Bazel configuration is not yet functional. This will fix the aforementioned issue.
Our puppy *LOVES* to demand attention when I'm on my laptop.
