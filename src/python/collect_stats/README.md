# Collect Stats

## Overview
Born out of an interview question and my resulting fumble. Lots to do.

The (currently) primary entry point is actually net/netstat.py
Tests are currently invoked directly:
`python3 test_netstat.py`

## Known Issues
- Too many *TODO*s
- Tests will not work without being copied/moved alongside netstat.py
- Bazel configuration is not yet functional. Resolving this will fix the aforementioned issue.
- Our puppy **LOVES** to demand attention when I'm on my laptop. This currently blocks all issues. (jk)
